## Challenge

In this workshop we'll follow a real case scenario where we have to solve a problem that is starting to become a plague in our technology area and consecutively the company's value delivery to its users and customers.

### Your challenge is as follows:

You lead a DevOps team with (security initiatives) at the company where the modernization of the company's main application architecture is finally being renewed. For this, an initiative was created in the company that includes DevOps engineers, cloud architects, developers and the security team.

For each area, the following part of the project was divided:

- <b>DevOps</b>: Enable quality delivery and continuous testing of the application and its new future features through CI/CD tools.

- <b>Arquiteto de cloud</b>: Define the new application architecture and which services will be needed in one or more clouds.

- <b>Time de Seguran√ßa</b>: Responsible in this project for providing security consistent with the new distributed architecture and that does not delay or hinder the speed of development. 

- <b>Desenvolvento</b>: Refactor part of the application so that it sends more metrics to the Observability platform that inform and are consistent with the business and needs of the company and with the new architecture.


#### In upcoming labs, we will go into more detail on how to address and solve these same business challenges.
